This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a bash script related to input redirection within a while loop. The script attempts to process a file line by line. However, if the file specified by \"file_to_process\" does not exist, the script silently fails without any error message.  The bug is in how input redirection is handled, leading to unexpected behavior. The solution addresses this by explicitly checking for the file's existence before attempting to process it.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in shell scripts to prevent unexpected and hard-to-debug issues.
